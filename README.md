## Hi, friend 👋🏼 I'm so glad you're here!

This is what I've been up to:
- 🧠 Deep learning and praciticing JavaScript daily 
- 💭 Problem solving coding challenges
- 🔎 Actively looking for junior developer opportunties
- 🏋🏻 Finding fun ways to challenge myself physically
- 🌱 Tending to my indoor plants and watching them bloom

And these are some things I plan do soon:
- 📐 Adapt my JS skills to learn Angular
- 👷🏻‍♀️ Continue to build applications that highlight my skills
- 👩🏻‍💻 Work for a company that welcomes critical thinkers
